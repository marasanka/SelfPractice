/*
 Divisibility, write a program that can check if a number is evenly divisible by 2, 3, 5,
			Ex:
				number = 65;  ==> int
				divisibleBy2 ==> true/false
				divisibleBy3 ==> true/false
				divisbileBy5 ==> true/false

			output:
				65 is divisible by 2: false
				65 is divisible by 3: false
				65 is divisible by 5: true


				number = 80;

			output:
				80 is divisible by 2: true
				80 is divisible by 3: false
				80 is divisible by 5: true
